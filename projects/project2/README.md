# Project 2: Pulse LED

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to pulse the LEDs in a 1 Hz triangular
wave where the effective brightness of the LED increases linearly to
some brightness then decreases linearly to zero. One full cycle from
0 to MAX brightness to 0 to MAX should take 1 second. 

## Objectives
1. Write a verilog module which can pulse an LED at 1 Hz
2. Use that verilog module to pulse an LED at 1 Hz

## File Descriptions
**project2.pcf** - pin configuration file that represents LED and CLK pins
**project2.v** - Top level verilog file which coordinate usage of modules
**pulse_led.v** - Verilog module which is capable of pulsing LED at 1 Hz
