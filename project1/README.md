# Project 1: Coordinated LED Blinking

## Problem Statement
The iCEStick has 5 LEDs placed on the PCB oriented in a "Plus" or "Cross".
The goal of this project is to coordinate the blinking of the LEDs such
that the center (yellow) LED stays illuminated while the outer 4 LEDs
blink one at a time intermittently in a circular pattern.

## Objectives
1. Write a synchronous verilog script
2. re-write that script in C/C++ and perform High-Level Synthesis

## File Descriptions
**project1.pcf** - pin configuration file that represents LED and CLK pins
**project1.v** - verilog file that describes the hardware circuit
